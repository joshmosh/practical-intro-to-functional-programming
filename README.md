# Practical Intro to Function Programming

Functional programming is a hard thing to grasp. No matter your experience level, or background, there are programming techniques that are learned over time with experience. If you're like myself, you're always looking for ways to improve your thought process. While reading about functional programming on [Mary Rose Cook's](http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming) website. I decided to create this project to follow along in all of the programming languages I'm familiar with.
